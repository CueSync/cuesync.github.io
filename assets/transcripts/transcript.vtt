00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.200
When I first received this Nobel Prize for
Literature, I got to wondering exactly how

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.030
my songs related to literature.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.340
I wanted to reflect on it and see where the
connection was.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.519
I'm going to try to articulate that to you.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.380
And most likely it will go in a roundabout
way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.380
and purposeful.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.489
If I was to go back to the dawning of it all,
I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.050
Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he
was twenty-two.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.250
From the moment I first heard him, I felt
akin.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.550
I felt related, like he was an older brother.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.649
I even thought I resembled him.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.610
Buddy played the music that I loved - the
music I grew up on: country western, rock

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.450
'n' roll, and rhythm and blues.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.330
Three separate strands of music that he intertwined
and infused into one genre.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.810
One brand.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.350
And Buddy wrote songs - songs that had beautiful
melodies and imaginative verses.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.070
And he sang great - sang in more than a few
voices.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.880
He was the archetype.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.390
Everything I wasn't and wanted to be.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.000
I saw him only but once, and that was a few
days before he was gone.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.370
I had to travel a hundred miles to get to
see him play, and I wasn't disappointed.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.740
He was powerful and electrifying and had a
commanding presence.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.549
I was only six feet away.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.610
He was mesmerizing.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.371
I watched his face, his hands, the way he
tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:48.010
eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his
guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.259
Everything about him.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.509
He looked older than twenty-two.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.770
Something about him seemed permanent, and
he filled me with conviction.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.049
Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing
happened.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.689
He looked me right straight dead in the eye,
and he transmitted something.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.689
Something I didn't know what.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.340
And it gave me the chills.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.090
I think it was a day or two after that that
his plane went down.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.389
And somebody - somebody I'd never seen before
- handed me a Leadbelly record with the song

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.870
"Cottonfields" on it.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.170
And that record changed my life right then
and there.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.900
Transported me into a world I'd never known.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.749
It was like an explosion went off.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.680
Like I'd been walking in darkness and all
of the sudden the darkness was illuminated.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.909
It was like somebody laid hands on me.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.969
I must have played that record a hundred times.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.620
It was on a label I'd never heard of with
a booklet inside with advertisements for other

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.269
artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie,

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.269
string bands.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.540
I'd never heard of any of them.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.889
But I reckoned if they were on this label
with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.209
needed to hear them.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.139
I wanted to know all about it and play that
kind of music.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.040
I still had a feeling for the music I'd grown
up with, but for right now, I forgot about

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040
it.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
Didn't even think about it.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.629
For the time being, it was long gone.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.160
I hadn't left home yet, but I couldn't wait
to.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.519
I wanted to learn this music and meet the
people who played it.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.709
Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to
play those songs.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.359
They were different than the radio songs that
I'd been listening to all along.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.339
They were more vibrant and truthful to life.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:32.989
With radio songs, a performer might get a
hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.370
cards, but that didn't matter in the folk
world.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.370
Everything was a hit.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.519
All you had to do was be well versed and be
able to play the melody.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.810
Some of these songs were easy, some not.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.459
I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads
and country blues, but everything else I had

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.209
to learn from scratch.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.219
I was playing for small crowds, sometimes
no more than four or five people in a room

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.689
or on a street corner.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.639
You had to have a wide repertoire, and you
had to know what to play and when.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.040
Some songs were intimate, some you had to
shout to be heard.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.629
By listening to all the early folk artists
and singing the songs yourself, you pick up

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.920
the vernacular.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.340
You internalize it.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.479
You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs,
Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.090
and cowboy songs.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.860
You hear all the finer points, and you learn
the details.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.470
You know what it's all about.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.340
Takin' the pistol out and puttin' it back
in your pocket.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.509
Whippin' your way through traffic, talkin'
in the dark.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.370
You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and
that Frankie was a good girl.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.069
You know that Washington is a bourgeois town
and you've heard the deep-pitched voice of

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.110
John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic
sink in a boggy creek.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.430
And you're pals with the wild Irish rover
and the wild colonial boy.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.789
You heard the muffled drums and the fifes
that played lowly.

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.159
You've seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a
knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.080
have been wrapped in white linen.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.949
I had all the vernacular down.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.400
I knew the rhetoric.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.270
None of it went over my head - the devices,
the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.000
- and I knew all the deserted roads that it
traveled on, too.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.820
I could make it all connect and move with
the current of the day.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.479
When I started writing my own songs, the folk
lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew,

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.800
and I used it.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.560
But I had something else as well.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.300
I had principles and sensibilities and an
informed view of the world.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.539
And I had had that for a while.

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.090
Learned it all in grammar school.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.239
Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's
Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:51.009
- typical grammar school reading that gave
you a way of looking at life, an understanding

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.460
of human nature, and a standard to measure
things by.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.439
I took all that with me when I started composing
lyrics.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.599
And the themes from those books worked their
way into many of my songs, either knowingly

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.620
or unintentionally.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.610
I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody
ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.490
Specific books that have stuck with me ever
since I read them way back in grammar school

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.389
- I want to tell you about three of them:
Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.219
and The Odyssey.

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:33.289
Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's
filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:34.979
dialogue.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.300
The book makes demands on you.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.740
The plot is straightforward.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.080
The mysterious Captain Ahab - captain of a
ship called the Pequod - an egomaniac with

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.020
a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great
white whale Moby Dick who took his leg.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.490
And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic
around the tip of Africa and into the Indian

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.590
Ocean.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.740
He pursues the whale around both sides of
the earth.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.930
It's an abstract goal, nothing concrete or
definite.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.660
He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the
embodiment of evil.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.449
Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket
that he reminisces about now and again.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.069
You can anticipate what will happen.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:23.370
The ship's crew is made up of men of different
races, and any one of them who sights the

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.930
whale will be given the reward of a gold coin.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.569
A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory,
stereotypes.

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:38.199
Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses
the captains for details about Moby.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.710
Have they seen him?

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.610
There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of
the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.240
Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god,
and that any dealings with him will lead to

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240
disaster.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.900
He says that to Captain Ahab.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.419
Another ship's captain - Captain Boomer - he
lost an arm to Moby.

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:01.740
But he tolerates that, and he's happy to have
survived.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.710
He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.740
This book tells how different men react in
different ways to the same experience.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:19.050
A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory:
Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:28.219
Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo,
Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Martha's Vineyard.

00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:30.650
The Pagans are idol worshippers.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.289
Some worship little wax figures, some wooden
figures.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.870
Some worship fire.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.130
The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.159
Moby Dick is a seafaring tale.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.610
One of the men, the narrator, says, "Call
me Ishmael."

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.630
Somebody asks him where he's from, and he
says, "It's not down on any map.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.300
True places never are."

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.880
Stubb gives no significance to anything, says
everything is predestined.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.800
Ishmael's been on a sailing ship his entire
life.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.680
Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.420
He keeps his distance from people.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.380
A typhoon hits the Pequod.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.420
Captain Ahab thinks it's a good omen.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.910
Starbuck thinks it's a bad omen, considers
killing Ahab.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.670
As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls
from the ship's mast and drowns, foreshadowing

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.840
what's to come.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:29.630
A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually
a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, "Some

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.270
men who receive injuries are led to God, others
are led to bitterness."

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.940
Everything is mixed in.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:44.240
All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible,
Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.510
Perseus, Hercules - they're all whalers.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.570
Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting
up a whale.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:58.129
Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge,
whale oil - good for coronation of royalty

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:01.449
- noble families in the whaling industry.

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:05.350
Whale oil is used to anoint the kings.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:12.990
History of the whale, phrenology, classical
philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:18.769
for discrimination - everything thrown in
and none of it hardly rational.

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:24.360
Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing
death, the great white whale, white as polar

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.110
bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the
nemesis, the embodiment of evil.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:36.060
The demented captain who actually lost his
leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060
knife.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.040
We see only the surface of things.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.850
We can interpret what lies below any way we
see fit.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:48.230
Crewmen walk around on deck listening for
mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.230
ship.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.089
Reading skulls and faces like you read a book.

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:52.199
Here's a face.

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:54.660
I'll put it in front of you.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.351
Read it if you can.

00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:58.160
Tashtego says that he died and was reborn.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.820
His extra days are a gift.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.850
He wasn't saved by Christ, though, he says
he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.029
at that.

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:08.910
He parodies the resurrection.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:14.870
When Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let
bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:20.699
back, "Speak not to me of blasphemy, man,
I'd strike the sun if it insulted me."

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:24.529
Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence.

00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:30.079
He says, "The path to my fixed purpose is
laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.079
to run."

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:36.790
Or these lines, "All visible objects are but
pasteboard masks."

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.310
Quotable poetic phrases that can't be beat.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.199
Finally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons
come out.

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.850
Boats are lowered.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.340
Ahab's harpoon has been baptized in blood.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.000
Moby attacks Ahab's boat and destroys it.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.870
Next day, he sights Moby again.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.329
Boats are lowered again.

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:58.509
Moby attacks Ahab's boat again.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:01.910
On the third day, another boat goes in.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.490
More religious allegory.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.100
He has risen.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.199
Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod
and sinking it.

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:13.860
Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines
and is thrown out of his boat into a watery

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.860
grave.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.579
Ishmael survives.

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:19.199
He's in the sea floating on a coffin.

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:20.800
And that's about it.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.910
That's the whole story.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:31.850
That theme and all that it implies would work
its way into more than a few of my songs.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.470
All Quiet on the Western Front was another
book that did.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.709
All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror
story.

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:45.380
This is a book where you lose your childhood,
your faith in a meaningful world, and your

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.360
concern for individuals.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.270
You're stuck in a nightmare.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.260
Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death
and pain.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.529
You're defending yourself from elimination.

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:00.740
You're being wiped off the face of the map.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:08.040
Once upon a time you were an innocent youth
with big dreams about being a concert pianist.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.230
Once you loved life and the world, and now
you're shooting it to pieces.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.279
Day after day, the hornets bite you and worms
lap your blood.

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:20.480
You're a cornered animal.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.870
You don't fit anywhere.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.339
The falling rain is monotonous.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:33.209
There's endless assaults, poison gas, nerve
gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline,

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:38.510
scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza,
typhus, dysentery.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.720
Life is breaking down all around you, and
the shells are whistling.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.870
This is the lower region of hell.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:52.920
Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats
eating the intestines of dead men, trenches

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.149
filled with filth and excrement.

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:57.589
Someone shouts, "Hey, you there.

00:13:57.589 --> 00:13:59.170
Stand and fight."

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.509
Who knows how long this mess will go on?

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:03.310
Warfare has no limits.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.370
You're being annihilated, and that leg of
yours is bleeding too much.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.290
You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke
to his corpse.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:17.519
You told him after this is over, you'll spend
the rest of your life looking after his family.

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.690
Who's profiting here?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.310
The leaders and the generals gain fame, and
many others profit financially.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.290
But you're doing the dirty work.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.140
One of your comrades says, "Wait a minute,
where are you going?"

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.879
And you say, "Leave me alone, I'll be back
in a minute."

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:37.930
Then you walk out into the woods of death
hunting for a piece of sausage.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.459
You can't see how anybody in civilian life
has any kind of purpose at all.

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:46.829
All their worries, all their desires - you
can't comprehend it.

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:52.000
More machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies
hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.399
legs and skulls where butterflies perch on
teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:04.930
of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big
for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.959
bodies making retching noises.

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.720
Death is everywhere.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.820
Nothing else is possible.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.380
Someone will kill you and use your dead body
for target practice.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.380
Boots, too.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.380
They're your prized possession.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.690
But soon they'll be on somebody else's feet.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.740
There's Froggies coming through the trees.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.089
Merciless bastards.

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:26.899
Your shells are running out.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:30.829
"It's not fair to come at us again so soon,"
you say.

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:36.250
One of your companions is laying in the dirt,
and you want to take him to the field hospital.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.579
Someone else says, "You might save yourself
a trip."

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:41.231
"What do you mean?"

00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.660
"Turn him over, you'll see what I mean."

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.980
You wait to hear the news.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.830
You don't understand why the war isn't over.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.542
The army is so strapped for replacement troops
that they're drafting young boys who are of

00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:58.579
little military use, but they're draftin'
'em anyway because they're running out of

00:15:58.579 --> 00:15:59.579
men.

00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:02.600
Sickness and humiliation have broken your
heart.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:11.960
You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters,
your ministers, and even your own government.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:18.930
The general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed
you too - turned you into a thug and a murderer.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.860
If you could, you'd put a bullet in his face.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.759
The commander as well.

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:29.070
You fantasize that if you had the money, you'd
put up a reward for any man who would take

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.170
his life by any means necessary.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:37.250
And if he should lose his life by doing that,
then let the money go to his heirs.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.480
The colonel, too, with his caviar and his
coffee - he's another one.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.420
Spends all his time in the officers' brothel.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.209
You'd like to see him stoned dead too.

00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:52.769
More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack
fo' me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars.

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:56.880
You kill twenty of 'em and twenty more will
spring up in their place.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.370
It just stinks in your nostrils.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:04.650
You've come to despise that older generation
that sent you out into this madness, into

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.339
this torture chamber.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.880
All around you, your comrades are dying.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:16.390
Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations,
shattered hipbones, and you think, "I'm only

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.260
twenty years old, but I'm capable of killing
anybody.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.830
Even my father if he came at me."

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:30.840
Yesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger
dog, and somebody shouted, "Don't be a fool."

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.680
One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.670
You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach,
but the man still lives.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.340
You know you should finish the job, but you
can't.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:49.010
You're on the real iron cross, and a Roman
soldier's putting a sponge of vinegar to your

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.010
lips.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.320
Months pass by.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.140
You go home on leave.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.190
You can't communicate with your father.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.710
He said, "You'd be a coward if you don't enlist."

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:03.970
Your mother, too, on your way back out the
door, she says, "You be careful of those French

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.410
girls now."

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.820
More madness.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.540
You fight for a week or a month, and you gain
ten yards.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.790
And then the next month it gets taken back.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:22.260
All that culture from a thousand years ago,
that philosophy, that wisdom - Plato, Aristotle,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.960
Socrates - what happened to it?

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.750
It should have prevented this.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.380
Your thoughts turn homeward.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.580
And once again you're a schoolboy walking
through the tall poplar trees.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.780
It's a pleasant memory.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.830
More bombs dropping on you from blimps.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.890
You got to get it together now.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:46.560
You can't even look at anybody for fear of
some miscalculable thing that might happen.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560
The common grave.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.260
There are no other possibilities.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:57.000
Then you notice the cherry blossoms, and you
see that nature is unaffected by all this.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.370
Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile
beauty of flowers, the sun - you see how nature

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.630
is indifferent to it all.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.550
All the violence and suffering of all mankind.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.150
Nature doesn't even notice it.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.440
You're so alone.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.020
Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of
your head and you're dead.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.150
You've been ruled out, crossed out.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.250
You've been exterminated.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.130
I put this book down and closed it up.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:31.130
I never wanted to read another war novel again,
and I never did.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.970
Charlie Poole from North Carolina had a song
that connected to all this.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:41.150
It's called "You Ain't Talkin' to Me," and
the lyrics go like this:

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.890
I saw a sign in a window walking up town one
day.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.910
Join the army, see the world is what it had
to say.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:54.200
You'll see exciting places with a jolly crew,
You'll meet interesting people, and learn

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200
to kill them too.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.440
Oh you ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talking
to me.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.520
I may be crazy and all that, but I got good
sense you see.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.760
You ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talkin'
to me.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.100
Killin' with a gun don't sound like fun.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:14.750
You ain't talkin' to me.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.640
The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have
worked its way into the ballads of a lot of

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.580
songwriters: "Homeward Bound, "Green, Green
Grass of Home," "Home on the Range," and my

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.640
songs as well.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.840
The Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale
of a grown man trying to get home after fighting

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.620
in a war.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.190
He's on that long journey home, and it's filled
with traps and pitfalls.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.380
He's cursed to wander.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.800
He's always getting carried out to sea, always
having close calls.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.740
Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.160
He angers people he shouldn't.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.130
There's troublemakers in his crew.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.570
Treachery.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:01.290
His men are turned into pigs and then are
turned back into younger, more handsome men.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.760
He's always trying to rescue somebody.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.580
He's a travelin' man, but he's making a lot
of stops.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.600
He's stranded on a desert island.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.540
He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.440
He meets giants that say, "I'll eat you last."

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.280
And he escapes from giants.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.670
He's trying to get back home, but he's tossed
and turned by the winds.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.990
Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.080
He travels far, and then he gets blown back.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.930
He's always being warned of things to come.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.810
Touching things he's told not to.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.950
There's two roads to take, and they're both
bad.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.970
Both hazardous.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:46.550
On one you could drown and on the other you
could starve.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:52.180
He goes into the narrow straits with foaming
whirlpools that swallow him.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.830
Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.460
Thunderbolts strike at him.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.170
Overhanging branches that he makes a leap
to reach for to save himself from a raging

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.380
river.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.070
Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others
want to kill him.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.070
He changes identities.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.260
He's exhausted.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.620
He falls asleep, and he's woken up by the
sound of laughter.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.730
He tells his story to strangers.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.140
He's been gone twenty years.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.300
He was carried off somewhere and left there.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.140
Drugs have been dropped into his wine.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.460
It's been a hard road to travel.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.200
In a lot of ways, some of these same things
have happened to you.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.130
You too have had drugs dropped into your wine.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.750
You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:46.530
You too have been spellbound by magical voices,
sweet voices with strange melodies.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.550
You too have come so far and have been so
far blown back.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.890
And you've had close calls as well.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.300
You have angered people you should not have.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.770
And you too have rambled this country all
around.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.820
And you've also felt that ill wind, the one
that blows you no good.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.470
And that's still not all of it.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.460
When he gets back home, things aren't any
better.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.570
Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage
of his wife's hospitality.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.870
And there's too many of 'em.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:23.290
And though he's greater than them all and
the best at everything - best carpenter, best

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:30.870
hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman
- his courage won't save him, but his trickery

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.870
will.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.710
All these stragglers will have to pay for
desecrating his palace.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.860
He'll disguise himself as a filthy beggar,
and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.420
with arrogance and stupidity.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.530
The servant's arrogance revolts him, but he
controls his anger.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:55.570
He's one against a hundred, but they'll all
fall, even the strongest.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.620
He was nobody.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:03.470
And when it's all said and done, when he's
home at last, he sits with his wife, and he

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.320
tells her the stories.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.300
So what does it all mean?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.830
Myself and a lot of other songwriters have
been influenced by these very same themes.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.560
And they can mean a lot of different things.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.120
If a song moves you, that's all that's important.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.000
I don't have to know what a song means.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.180
I've written all kinds of things into my songs.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.190
And I'm not going to worry about it - what
it all means.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:34.050
When Melville put all his old testament, biblical
references, scientific theories, Protestant

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:40.320
doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea
and sailing ships and whales into one story,

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.930
I don't think he would have worried about
it either - what it all means.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:51.850
John Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived
in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words,

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.540
"The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.330
Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests."

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.830
I don't know what it means, either.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.260
But it sounds good.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.800
And you want your songs to sound good.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.490
When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed
warrior Achilles in the underworld - Achilles,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:19.660
who traded a long life full of peace and contentment
for a short one full of honor and glory - tells

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.990
Odysseus it was all a mistake.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.790
"I just died, that's all."

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.650
There was no honor.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.510
No immortality.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:34.120
And that if he could, he would choose to go
back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:41.600
on Earth rather than be what he is - a king
in the land of the dead - that whatever his

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:49.600
struggles of life were, they were preferable
to being here in this dead place.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.250
That's what songs are too.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.320
Our songs are alive in the land of the living.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.600
But songs are unlike literature.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.510
They're meant to be sung, not read.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.020
The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant
to be acted on the stage.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:09.160
Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung,
not read on a page.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.410
And I hope some of you get the chance to listen
to these lyrics the way they were intended

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:19.950
to be heard: in concert or on record or however
people are listening to songs these days.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:26.650
I return once again to Homer, who says, "Sing
in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story."
